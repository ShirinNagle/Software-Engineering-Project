# Project Description
The project contains a personal database for albums. By clicking on the add new album link the user can add their own album titles, associated artist, give the album a rating, a review and album release
date. The user can sort the database table alphabetically in ascending order by clicking on the table heading "Title" or "Artist". The user can search by release date also going from 
earliest to most recent. The filter option allows the user to filter out albums by rating. The albums can be rated from a score of 0 -5. If the user clicks on 5 and all 
other numbers are unclicked only the albums with a rating of 5 will be displayed. The search feature allows a user to search if an album title is included in the database.
The album database allows a user to edit an album details, show the album on its own page and delete the album entirely if the user wishes.
